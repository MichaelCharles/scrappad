# Scrappad

Scrappad is an aggressively minimalistic text editor for the web. Content written in Scrappad will be persisted via cookies.

## Note from October 11, 2023

I would be shocked if there's anyone out there using this other than me, but I made a major change to Scrappad and want to provide an explanation.

Scrappad is an extremely simple utility that I created back when I was using a Chromebook 24/7. At the time, there were no lightweight text editors for Chromebook. So, whenever I wanted to temporarily paste some text to use later, or simply have a straightforward place to deposit text, I didn't have many options.

Enter Scrappad: It is aggressively simple. It saves the content of the sole textarea to cookies and restores them in case the browser closes or the PC crashes. It has straightforward import and export functions for text files. It was perfect for me.

To this day, I still open the GitHub pages version of it for a simple place to put my text.

Today (October 11, 2023), I made it even simpler by removing the text file export/import functions, since I never used them.

I plan to continue using Scrappad as my super-simple temporary text notepad.

Old habits die hard.
